                <ol>
                    <li>Left, untuk mengatur posisi elemen berada disebelah kiri.</li>
                    <li>Right, untuk mengatur posisi elemen berada di sebelah kanan.</li>
                    <li>Inherit, posisi elemen mengikuti float dari parent.</li>
                    <li>None, untuk mengatur agar elemen tidak boleh di float.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
