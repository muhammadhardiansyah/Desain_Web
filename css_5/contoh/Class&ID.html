                Samurai (侍, /ˈsæmʊraɪ/) were the hereditary military nobility and officer caste of medieval and early-modern Japan from the 12th 
                century to their abolition in the 1870s. They were the well-paid retainers of the daimyo (the great feudal landholders). They had 
                high prestige and special privileges such as wearing two swords. They cultivated the bushido codes of martial virtues, indifference 
                to pain, and unflinching loyalty, engaging in many local battles. During the peaceful Edo era (1603 to 1868) they became the stewards and 
                chamberlains of the daimyo estates, gaining managerial experience and education. In the 1870s samurai families comprised 5% of the population.

                In Japanese, they are usually referred to as bushi (武士, [bɯ.ɕi]), meaning 'warrior', or buke (武家). According to translator William Scott Wilson: 
                "In Chinese, the character 侍 was originally a verb meaning 'to wait upon', 'accompany persons' in the upper ranks of society, and this is also true 
                of the original term in Japanese, saburau. In both countries the terms were nominalized to mean 'those who serve in close attendance to the nobility', 
                the Japanese term saburai being the nominal form of the verb." According to Wilson, an early reference to the word samurai appears in the Kokin Wakashū, 
                the first imperial anthology of poems, completed in the 10th century.
